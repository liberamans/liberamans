- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mahima.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in books, music and interesting people.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to maintain a personal blog on the internet because I think I've got a lot of things to say and it seems like the best way not to have to say them. While also saying them. Okay, that makes perfect sense, let's move on.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Please feel free to email me at mahimamukherjee0201@gmail.com if you have any thoughts you'd like to share or just start a conversation. Probably needless to add, I really enjoy conversations.
